# Overview

This repository contains a jupyter notebook showing how to implement a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch in Tensorflow 2 to detect landmarks/keypoints from people's faces.

You will learn how to:
- Preprocess faces and landmarks.
- Perform data augmentations on BOTH faces and landmarks.
- Create a tensorflow dataset to load and process faces and landmarks.
- Implement a custom CNN to predict keypoints from facial images using Keras's Functional API.
- Perform inference on other faces and visualize the results.

I hope that this will help you in developing a deeper understanding of using CNNs for keypoint detection in TF2.

## Instructions:
- Please unzip and extract the faces and landmarks into a separate folder.
- Please follow the steps in the jupyter notebook closely.
