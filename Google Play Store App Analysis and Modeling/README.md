# Overview

**Note: This project was a final group project for my Intro to Data Science course at LUMS. Credit goes to my colleagues as well including Shahzeb, Mahad, and Suleiman.**

This repository contains a jupyter notebook showing how to carry out Google Play Store App Analysis and Ratings Prediction in Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
You will learn how to:
- Carry out data cleaning and processing to prepare the dataset for modelling.
- Plot all sorts of visualizations to gain insights into relationships between App Rating and other key features.
- Perform custom feature engineering using `Column Transformers` and `Function Transformers` in Scikit-Learn.
- Create custom `Pipelines` in Sklearn to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Compare model performance in Sklearn using various metrics.
- Carry out intepretability analysis using `Random Forests`' information gain feature importances.

I hope that this will help you in learning how to perform detailed exploratory data analysis and use Sklearn effectively for machine learning.

## Instructions:
- I recommend opening the notebook in google colab.
- Please follow the steps in the jupyter notebook closely.
