# Overview

**Note: This project was originally an assignment in my Deep Learning course at LUMS.**

This repository contains a jupyter notebook showing how to implement your own DCGAN model from scratch in Keras to generate images of various emojis.

You will learn how to:
- Implementing the discriminator and generator from scratch in Keras using the Functional API.
- Implement a custom loop to train the DCGAN for emoji generation.
- Stabilize DCGANs using LeakyReLUs, Label Smoothing, Normalization, Gaussian Weight Initilization and a few other tricks.

I hope that this will help you in developing a deeper understanding of implementing and using DCGANs for image generation.

## Instructions:
- Please unzip and extract emojis into a separate folder.
- Please follow the steps in the jupyter notebook closely.
