# Overview

This repository contains a jupyter notebook showing how to implement your own customer Transformer model from scratch in Tensorflow 2.0 to translate English into Spanish.

Please follow the jupyter notebook closely.

You will learn the following:
- Basic preprocessing of text data including padding and tokenization.
- Defining all important components of a modern Transformer model for machine translation (Positional Embeddings, Multi-Head Attention, etc.) in Keras and Tensorflow 2.0
- Implement a custom learning rate schedule in Keras.
- Implement custom training and evaluation loops in Tensorflow 2.0 specifically for machine translation.

I hope that this will help you in developing a deeper understanding of Transformers and how to implement them in Keras and TF2.

Note: This tutorial is highly inspired from the following Keras tutorial:
