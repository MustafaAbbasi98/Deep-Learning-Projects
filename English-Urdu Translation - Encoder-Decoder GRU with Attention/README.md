# Overview

This repository contains a jupyter notebook showing how to implement your own Encoder-Decoder GRU model with Attention from scratch in Tensorflow 2.0 to translate English into Urdu.

Please follow the jupyter notebook closely.

You will learn the following:
- Basic preprocessing of text data including padding and tokenization.
- Implementing the GRU Encoder and Decoder with Attention using custom Keras layers.
- Implement custom training and evaluation loops in Tensorflow 2.0 specifically for machine translation.
- Evaluate model using Attention Heatmaps.

I hope that this will help you in developing a deeper understanding of Attention for translation and how to implement it in Keras and TF2 for your own use case.
