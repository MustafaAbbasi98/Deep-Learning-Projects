# Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects that I have completed either as a student, a researcher or just for passion.

Please click on any project folder that interests you to navigate to that project's repository.

For each project, I have tried to provide additional helpful tutorials and references.

I hope that these projects will help you learn and expand your own skills and knowledge!
